# PROJECT: EMBEDDING IMAGES AND VIDEOS
### Project Description
The goal here isn’t to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but to focus on making the media elements show up.
That means two things – embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images 
along the right side.)
